## Roadmap

1. Identify use cases, including "key" use cases 
2. Identify key building blocks (such as: speech recognition engines, data extraction strategies, UX patterns)
3. Research and validate different approach for the key building blocks
4. Select one or more platforms and develop architecture to flexibly connect and configure the building blocks
5. Implement the architecture and the building blocks on the selected platforms
6. Implement the key use cases using the above
7. Evaluation, refinement

## Using DCO to sign your commits

All commits must be signed with a DCO signature to avoid being flagged by the DCO Bot. This means that your commit log message must contain a line that looks like the following one, with your actual name and email address:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` will add that line automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.
